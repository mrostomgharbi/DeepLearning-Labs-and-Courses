# Analysis
#
# If the network is initialized to zero weights, the activations of the hidden
# layers are always set to zero, whatever the value of the inputs. The gradient
# is always zero for all training samples and no learning can happen with any
# gradient-based optimizer (SGD, Adam...): the loss stays constant.
#
# A network with null weights has null gradients but this not a local minimum
# (nor a local maximum): it is a saddle point at the center of a neighborhood
# with very low gradients.
#
# Therefore when the scale of a random initializations of the weights is too
# small, SGD has a hard time evading that area of low gradients. Adding
# momentum can help but especially for deep networks it can take many epochs to
# evade the area.
#
# Initializing the weights with large random values will make the output
# distribution (softmax) very peaky: the network is very "confident" of its
# predictions even if they are completely random. This leads to a very high
# initial loss value.
#
# The softmax function does not saturate (bad classification always have a
# non-zero gradient). However the intermediate tanh layers can saturate,
# therefore squashing the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters
# of the first "Dense" layer and making the network train much slower.
#
# The Glorot uniform init uses a scale that depends on the dimensions of the
# weight matrix so has to preserve the average norm of activations and flowing
# gradients so as to make learning possible. Keras provides alternatives that
# can be better in some cases. Please refer to the references in the Keras
# documentation to learn more on the theoretical justifications behind those
# schemes.
#
# Adam tends to be more robust when it comes to bad initialization thanks to
# its per-weight learning rate adjustments but still benefits from a good
# initialization.
#
# More on this in a later class on optimization issues. For now  just remember
# that if you network fails to learn at all (the loss stays at its initial
# value):
#
# - ensure that the weights are properly initialized,
# - inspect the per-layer gradient norms to help identify the bad layer,
# - use Adam instead of SGD as your default go to initializer.
