# We observe that heatmap_1 and heatmap_2 gave coarser 
# segmentations than heatmap_3. However, heatmap_3
# has small artifacts outside of the dog area
# heatmap_3 encodes more local, texture level information
# about the dog, while lower resolutions will encode more
# semantic information about the full object
# combining them is probably a good idea!
