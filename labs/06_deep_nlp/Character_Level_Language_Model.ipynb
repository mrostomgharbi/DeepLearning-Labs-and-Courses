    "- **train** a (bi-directional) **deep language model on a very large, unlabeled corpus** (e.g. 1 billion words or more);\n",
    "- plug the resulting **language model as the input layer** (and sometimes also the output layer) **of a task specific architecture**, for instance: text classification, semantic role labeling for knowledge extraction, logical entailment, question answering and reading comprehension;\n",
    "- **train the task specific parameters** of the new architecture on the **smaller task-labeled corpus**;\n",
